            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a student at the University of North Carolina pursuing a BS in Computer Science, as well as a minor in Statistics and Analytics.
                My interest in coding began when I started playing chess. As I got more serious, I started studying game theory using chess engines. 
                Chess engines opened my eyes to the power of computing machines, and I longed to yeild that power. I have taken an abundance of courses,
                teaching me the principles of object oriented programming, software engineering, cumputer architecture, and databases. I have experience
                in full stack develepment and enjoy all sides of the computing world.
